# Movie-Recommender-System
Creating a movie recommender system based on K-Means and Mini-Batch K-means
One of the most significant issues is finding the optimal number of clusters and convergence speed.
In this project, we focus on clustering with different approaches and try to recommend topK Movies to people based on their previous ratings and other users' interests.
Dataset=1000K MovieLens
